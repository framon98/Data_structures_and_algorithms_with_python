# The Loop and a half
Validating the condition is met before entering the while loop
```python
firstLine = file.readline.strip()

while firstLine != '':
	#Read the Rest
```

# The Accumulator Pattern
we initialize the accumulator before a loop and then inside the loop you ad to the accumulator
```python
# initialize the accumulator
accumulator = []

#write some kind of for loop or while loop
for i ni range(1,11):
	# add to the accumulator, in this case add to the list
	accumulator = accumulator +[i ** 2]
```
